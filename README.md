# pygame.snake
pygame.snake is a basic snake game built with python using the pygame library. Upon pygame.snake's first launch a menu displaying the game title, a play button, and a quit button is drawn to the window. If the user decides to click the "Quit" button, the game is quickly shut down. Although, if the user decides to click the "Play" button, a maze of cubes is drawn to the screen. The green cube, the snake, is interactable through the keys: ```W: Move Up``` ```A: Move Left``` ```S: Move Down``` and ```D: Move Right```
